Devel-DTrace-Provider version 0.01
==================================

This is a Perl port of "ruby-dtrace", bindings for the probe and 
consumer APIs of DTrace. 

What works:

  * Declarative provider construction
  * DOF generation and loading
  * Firing probes directly, with arguments
  * Probes exported into application code
  * Is-enabled checks

Tests are under development: DTrace requires root (or other elevated
privileges) so testing live probes is troublesome. Basic tests should
be working.

Currently only supporting Mac OS X Leopard - Solaris support under
development.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

Requires DTrace support on your platform, and initially is only 
targetting i386.
